# PIDcontrol
A simple PID controller and a test bench designed to visualize the function of a model PID controller under different conditions

DEPENDENCIES:


PROJECT GOAL:

Provide a tool to quickly visualize and understand the concept behind a model PID controller 

CURRENT SCOPE:

PID control of a second order linear system with damping under the influence of external forces

CURRENT FEATURES:

Adjust process parameters to model different second order systems

Adjust PID parameters to observe resulting effects on the controlled system

Visualize the PID control output and its effects on the plant under test

USE CASES:

Analyse the stability of model PID systems under a variety of conditions
